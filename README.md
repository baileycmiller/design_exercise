* Implement the design in `/psd/web.psd` into `/html`
* Send us a pull request when you're finished - Don't know how to pull request? [Checkout this video](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/117-lets-attempt-to-do-a-pull-request/)

Feel free to use any tools or frameworks you want. We use the [Foundation CSS Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) around here, so you may want to check that out.
