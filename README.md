This is a quick little exercise for you to show off your Ã¼ber awesome html/css chops.

Here's what you need to do:

* Clone this repo - New to git? [Checkout this video](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/101-lets-suck-at-github-together/)
* Implement the design in `/psd/web.psd` into `/html`
* Package up your files and send it to Dewayne via email

Feel free to use any tools or frameworks you want. We use the [Foundation CSS Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) around here, so you may want to check that out.
